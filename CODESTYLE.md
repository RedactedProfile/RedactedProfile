# Ky CodingStyle
----
wip. this informal document is evolving over time, and the items written here may flucuate over time as I make decisions while working on projects that better suit my needs. 

----

note: This isn't for anybody else but me. I find my coding style bounces around quite often, and when it comes to naming things, even in the same class it can be inconsistent. I need a document like this for myself, to answer my own questions about how I can code things within my power.
