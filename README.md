## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ky. 

I am a web developer by profession, and game developer by hobby.  You will absolutely find a mixture of both here.

I keep a general DevLog of all my projects here: https://redactedgames.ca/ky

### ðŸ”­ Currently Working On
I work on several projects simultaneously. These are my personal projects that keep me sane:
* BlackLotus: a 2.5D Raycaster game inspired by Wolf3D, written with C++ and OpenGL
* Kringle, a DirectX christmas game designed for the Xbox One platform 

I like to contribute where I can, here are the projects I volunteer code or documentation too:
* [CSS-Sprite](https://github.com/pmaxs/css-sprite), a configurable PHP package to generate a sprite sheet from a directory of images

I live stream programming at:
* [twitch.tv/silent_coyote](https://twitch.tv/silent_coyote) 

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
* C++
* OpenGL 
* DirectX
* .NET Core
