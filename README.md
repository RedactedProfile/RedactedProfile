## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ky. 

I am a web developer by profession, and game developer by hobby.  You will absolutely find a mixture of both here.

I keep a general DevLog of all my projects here: https://redacteddevworks.ca 

### ðŸ”­ Currently Working
I work on several projects simultaneously. These are my personal projects that keep me sane:
* [BlackLotus](https://redacted-games.itch.io/blacklotus), a 2.5D Raycaster game inspired by Wolf3D, written with C++ and OpenGL
* [Corrode](https://github.com/RedactedProfile/Corrode), a 3D cyberpunk game inspired by Hotline Miami 
* [Echo](https://github.com/RedactedProfile/Echo), an in-memory cache database, authored with the new Deno runtime
* StreamRaiser, a series of Streamer tools authored with Angular and Node. (private for now, open soon)

I like to contribute where I can, here are the projects I volunteer code or documentation too:
* [CSS-Sprite](https://github.com/pmaxs/css-sprite), a configurable PHP package to generate a sprite sheet from a directory of images

I live stream programming at:
* [twitch.tv/silent_coyote](https://twitch.tv/silent_coyote) 

I upload tech related content at:
* [KyTech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvHTsQyArPbbqvPo65qLE0g)

I release game project footage to
* [RedactedGames](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvdzsh3GwQLCxAVAHokhe7Q)
