## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Ky. 

I am a web developer by profession, and game developer by hobby.  You will absolutely find a mixture of both here.

### ðŸ”­ Currently Working
I work on several projects simultaneously. These are my personal projects that keep me sane:
* [BlackLotus](https://github.com/RedactedProfile/BlackLotus), a 2.5D Raycaster game inspired by Wolf3D, written with C++ and OpenGL
* [Corrode](https://github.com/RedactedProfile/Corrode), a 3D cyberpunk game inspired by Hotline Miami 
* [Echo](https://github.com/RedactedProfile/Echo), an in-memory cache database, authored with the new Deno runtime
* StreamRaiser, a series of Streamer tools authored with Angular and Node. (private for now, open soon)

I like to contribute where I can, here are the projects I volunteer code or documentation too:
* [CSS-Sprite](https://github.com/pmaxs/css-sprite), a configurable PHP package to generate a sprite sheet from a directory of images

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
* C++
* OpenGL 
* ES6 JS
