End of the Road, finally.

That last post back in March? Man, how a LOT can change in such a short time.

Since then I received a "Return to Office — Full Time" order from my employer, and money stress followed fast. Shortly after COVID lockdowns sent everyone home, my employer (a security tech company) looked like it wanted to be the leader in work-from-home security. My wife and I decided it was time to buy our first home. Our modest budget didn’t cover much; first-time homebuyer incentives topped out at $500,000, but the average house within commuting distance to my employer started at $600,000. Gotta love the GVA (Greater Vancouver Area).

We kept looking. Eventually we found a great townhouse in a smaller town — rolling green fields, fruit stands where you could buy straight from the harvesters, kid-friendly schools, and room for a dog. Best of all, a third floor I could turn into a home office. We bought it.

Not long after, our reliable family vehicle, a 2016 Dodge Grand Caravan, started getting less reliable. I bought that minivan with 22 km on the odometer; now it had crossed 100,000 km and problems were showing. Winter was coming and I needed something dependable. In a small town full of pickups, some older part of me woke up — hunting, camping, woodworking — and I traded the minivan for a 2020 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Warlock. I was elated. We took that truck on many family adventures.

Four years later, regret crept in, not because the truck wasn't great but because the Return-to-Office mandate turned my adventure mobile into a pavement princess. The cost to fuel a 5.7L V8 Hemi was brutal. When I picked up the truck gas was $1.31/L; after a while it shot up to $2.35–$2.75/L. Driving to the office full-time put me broke more often than I expected. I canceled subscriptions, ate cheaper, and told my kids "no" more than I liked. It shattered me.

It was time for change. I spent months in deep research: smaller sedans, hatchbacks, hybrids, RAV4s — everything. Tiny gains here and there, but fuel was the killer.

We also had a broken Jeep that my wife used. Mold from a bad windshield gasket made the interior gross, then someone threw a rock through the back window and it was done. Repair costs were too high, so we let it go. Around the same time my mother was gifted a Mercedes and offered our wife her 2007 Passat. Huge deal. We made a family trip to pick it up.

Driving that Passat felt natural. I suggested using it for the commute and saving the truck for errands and adventures. My wife agreed, but the Passat had 320k on the odometer and was meant for her. It was more efficient than the truck, but my highway-heavy commute and the Passat's V6 didn’t save as much as I hoped.

Then I noticed a nearby VW dealership and thought, why not at least listen? A week later I drove off the lot with a brand-new 2025 VW ID.4 AWD Pro S.

Electric. Fully electric. I might write a full follow-up about the decision process, but in short: ditching gasoline and oil for an EV (and charging at home where possible) solved the cost problem. No more oil changes, spark plugs, fuel pumps, or timing belts. Regenerative braking reduces brake wear. I still learned the hard way about charging logistics and how climate affects range, but overall the math favored EV ownership for my commute.

It wasn’t all smooth: I couldn’t charge at home exactly how I wanted at first, and an EV still chews through battery on long drives, but public charging was still far cheaper than gas. My ID.4 drains differently than the Ram drank fuel, but the cost per week dropped significantly.

Summer was a mountain of adjustments: acclimating to a new schedule, too much socializing for this massive introvert, and a lot of family duties. Exhaustion took over and I spent a bunch of the warm months melting on the couch catching up on shows with my wife.

We’re on the other side of summer now and routines are returning. I also finally finished that client’s site — slow churn thanks to the whole life spiral, but it’s done and I’m proud of it.

Time to unplug the car and let someone else charge. I’ll post more details in the next one.

Cheers,
